# Bite-Sized Birding
##### A full-stack web app completed as a capstone project for Hackbright Academy.

### Introduction:
I am an avid birder and love observing the species in my own back yard, as well as observing new birds when I travel. I wanted to create a site that made it easy for people to learn about birds in a way that was directly relevant to them at their location and time of year. 

### Features:
- Ability to search by specific location.
- Returns list of the twelve most recent bird sightings near that location  with information, a photo, and a vocalization for each species.
- Offers a printable version of the sightings list to take with you into the field.
- Option to see additional information on any bird.
- A multiple-choice quiz based on the personalized birding list, built with React JS.
